femmejournal (0.1.0) stable; urgency=low

  First stable release

  This version builds and runs with Debian 9's Qt 5.7 and upstream's Qt
  5.7 for Android.  It has been in continuous testing by a single user for
  most of a year on a Z10, and also ran on a Nexus 4 before that.

  After this release, I intend to make breaking changes needed to fix some
  quirks on upstream's Qt 5.11 for Debian and for Android, followed by a
  release named 1.0.
